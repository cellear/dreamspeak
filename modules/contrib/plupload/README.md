#  Plupload

This module integrates the Plupload library version 1.5.8 with Backdrop forms.

This is a port from the Drupal module of the same name, version 7.x-1.7.

The Plupload library provides a JavaScript API for dealing with file uploads.
It supports features like multiple file selection, file type filtering, request chunking, 
client side image scaling and it uses different runtimes to achieve this 
such as HTML 5, Silverlight, Flash, Gears and BrowserPlus.
Visit http://plupload.com for details.

Note that **Versions 2.x and 3.x of the library are currently unsupported**. 
The latest 1.x.x version is 1.5.8 which has been obtained 
from https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload/archive/v1.5.8.zip.


## Features

  - Supported Fields: Image, File
  - Integration of plupload for file-uploads
      (Works in almost every browser and device!)
  - Batch entity creation (Fill out one form, the batch process will do the rest)
  - Overview page for generated nodes (Mostly like admin/content/node)
  - Pathalias integration (Settings for a node type will be used)
  - Choose default values (The other fields assigned to the selected bundle
       (node type, taxonomy vocabulary) will be displayed with the selected widgets
        and you may add some default values)
  - Tokens integration for titles (Choose from user, node, file, date and
    many more tokens)
