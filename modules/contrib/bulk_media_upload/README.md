# Bulk Media Upload

With Bulk Media Upload you can upload a batch of (media) files and a
new node will be created for every file. The files are selected via
a browser file upload dialog and can be stored in a media, file or
image field. Also default values can be chosen for the other fields
assigned to the new node,

This is a port from the Drupal module of the same name, version 7.x-1.x-dev

## Status

This is an initial port of the module ready for testing.

## Features

  - Supported Fields: Image, File
  - Integration of plupload for file-uploads
      (Works in almost every browser and device!)
  - Batch entity creation (Fill out one form, the batch process will do the rest)
  - Overview page for generated nodes (Mostly like admin/content/node)
  - Pathalias integration (Settings for a node type will be used)
  - Choose default values (The other fields assigned to the selected bundle
       (node type, taxonomy vocabulary) will be displayed with the selected widgets
        and you may add some default values)
  - Tokens integration for titles (Choose from user, node, file, date and
    many more tokens)
