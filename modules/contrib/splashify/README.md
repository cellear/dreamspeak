# Splashify

Splashify is a full featured splash page module that is designed to be search
engine friendly. It allows you to specify a page to be displayed anywhere on 
your site, using one of a few different delivery options (redirect, popup 
window or Colorbox). The module also provides options specific to mobile devices.

The main focus of this module is the following:

- Be search engine friendly by redirecting via JavaScript (when applicable).
- Allow specific options for mobile devices.
- Allow different ways in delivering the splash page.
- Use Colorbox for displaying the splash page in a lightbox.
- Provide options as to what gets displayed (have the system pick from a random
list of splash pages, have a list of splash pages show up in a specified order, 
display the specified text/html in the site template or display the text/html 
full screen).
