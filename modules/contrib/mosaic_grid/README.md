Mosaic Grid
===========

Mosaic Grid is a Views style plugin that allows to display images in a nice responsive justified grid. Best works as a single large full page image gallery but can also be used as a block and for creating multiple galleries on a page. Here is a short list of features:

- Justified responsive grid layout for images.
- Optimised image loading (lazy loading).
- Captions that appear over the image bottom, either statically, or on mouse hover.
- Ability to tweak caption style without writing extra CSS.
- Ability to use rich text for captions (by adding text fields in views).
- Several loader icon styles to choose from.
